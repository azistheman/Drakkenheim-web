<h1>The Amethyst Academy</h1>
<p>background</p>
<p>The Amethyst Academy began as a secret school for young
sorcerers during a time when arcane magic faced extreme
persecution from the clergy of the Sacred Flame. The mages
located children who manifested magical talents, rescued them
from their fearful and paranoid communities, and educated
them in hidden strongholds and far-away castles so they might
wield their abilities with trained and refined control. The secret
school gradually grew into a secret society in its own right.
Sequestered in unseen universities to hide from the mage-slaying
Knights of the Silver Order, the mages pooled their knowledge.
They conducted research into arcane and cosmological
phenomena, and developed the modern practice of wizardry.
Over time, the Amethyst Academy secured allies amongst the
nobility by providing them clandestine magical services and
occult counsel, crafting enchanted heirlooms, protecting their
castles with arcane wards, and teaching their heirs magic.
When these schemes were discovered by the Faith of the
Sacred Flame, a renewed series of brutal inquisitions and vengeful
witch-hunts began. What had been a shadow conflict between
paladins and sorcerers for centuries spilled into outright war
between noble houses who championed the Faith, and those that
supported the Amethyst Academy. These conflicts ended with
the Edicts of Lumen. Enacted three
hundred years ago, this landmark treaty stopped the murderous
suppression of arcane magic by the religious ministry, and
established a new balance of power between mages, the Faith,
and the nobility throughout the continent.The Edicts of Lumen bestow extensive protections, full
autonomy, and economic advantages to the Amethyst Academy, but also require the Academy to observe strict standards of
mercantile neutrality and political non-intervention. Most importantly, it grants the Amethyst Academy guardianship of any
child who demonstrates magical aptitude until they come of age
and master their abilities. In exchange, the agreement stipulates
that all arcane spellcasters are disinherited from any land, rank,
or titles, including the scions of noble and royal families. Since
the Edicts, Academy mages may work magic without fear of oppression from church or state, though the organization remains
withdrawn as it increasingly turns its attention to global affairs
and extraplanar happenings. However, the direction and focus
of the Amethyst Academy has dramatically shifted following
the destruction of Drakkenheim, when their greatest stronghold
was cut off from them.
While the Amethyst Academy outwardly upholds the Edicts
of Lumen, in recent years some have claimed the mages furtively flaunt its restrictions and disregard the terms that forbid
dark magical practices. Others suspect the mages are weaving
an arcane conspiracy to control commerce and influence politics
while shielding themselves from the wrath of the Sacred Flame.</p>

<h1>The Followers of the Falling Fire</h1>
<p>not much is readly avable other then they are a segment or break off of the religon "the sacred flame".
<h1>The Hooded Lanterns</h1>
<p>Multiple military operations have attempted to retake Drakkenheim over the past fifteen years. Each has ended in miserable
failure, and the contaminated ruins have swallowed thousands
of soldiers’ lives. What remains of these assaults are merely
twisted monsters and undead monstrosities formed from the
risen corpses of these regiments. After these disastrous attempts,
Drakkenheim was left abandoned while civil war ripped Westemär apart instead. These conflicts also ended in vain, with the
royal line of House von Kessel undone by fratricide.
Westemär is slowly disintegrating into a realm of squabbling
fiefdoms, yet some amongst the fractured nobility hold a glimmer of hope in restoring the nation and rebuilding the capital.
Three years ago, they marshaled up the remnants of the royal
guard, the city watch, and patriotic veterans of the civil war to
make one last-ditch attempt to retake the city. Although officially dubbed the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force to Reclaim
the Capital, this guerilla regiment was nicknamed after oil lamps
carried by the old city watch: the Hooded Lanterns.
The core members of the Hooded Lanterns are warriors
fighting for their homeland. Few honest soldiers survived the
civil war, so many veterans have a life of bloody deeds behind
them already. On the other hand, new recruits are seldom old
enough to have any strong memories of Drakkenheim before
it was destroyed. As such, many possess naïve and idealistic
notions honed into simmering rage and fury at a golden age
stolen from them.Under the leadership of Lord Commander Elias Drexel,
the Hooded Lanterns have finally broken the losing streak of
previous military operations. Rather than making an all-out
assault on the ruins, they have taken a methodical approach.
After spending nearly a year carefully scouting out the ruins,
they began clearing out important fortifications in the city
to use as staging grounds for future operations. This strategy
has paid off: the Hooded Lanterns have managed to establish
countless safehouses and supply caches within the city. They
captured Shepherd’s Gate and the Drakkenheim Garrison
last year. However, in recent months their efforts have been
stymied by sabotage enacted by the Queen of Thieves, and
the emergence of a horrific garmyr warlord in the Inner City
known as the Lord of the Feast. While the Hooded Lanterns
have imposed the mantle of law-and-order in the city, these
setbacks have revealed their actual authority is limited to their
strength of arms. The regiment maintains only a fragile foothold in Drakkenheim, and their supply lines are now exceptionally difficult to maintain. It’s taking almost everything the
Hooded Lanterns have to hold their current position.
The Hooded Lanterns are supported by surviving loyal
vassals of the royal family who wish to see the old monarchy of
Westemär restored. Many of these wealthy nobles lost estates,
treasure vaults, family heirlooms, and personal documents when
the city was destroyed, and expect the Hooded Lanterns to
retrieve them. In return, these noble houses provide soldiers,
material, and other supplies to the Hooded Lanterns on a
periodic basis, but their financial resources are not inexhaustible.
Indeed, the Hooded Lanterns have often resorted to selling
delerium themselves to make ends meet.</p>
<p>The Hooded Lanterns are a professional military unit. Every
member uses standardized equipment: their uniform consists
of a forest green cloak with yellow trim, the traditional colours
associated with the Drakkenheim coat-of-arms. They bear the
Hooded Lanterns’ symbol on their chest pieces, and shoulder
stitches denote their rank and company. Scout units wear light
armour, and often wield longswords, shortswords, and longbows.
Guard units are equipped with chainmail, shields, spears, and
crossbows. Each member also wears a metal chain with an
inscribed plate bearing their name, hometown, and next of
kin. Most Hooded Lanterns cut their hair when they sign up,
but since many spend weeks at a time fighting, they end up a
disheveled mess by the end of their assignments.</p>
<h1>The knights of the silver order</h1>
<p>The Silver Order was founded several centuries ago as a militant
arm of the Faith of the Sacred Flame. These knights and
paladins act by the decree of the Divine Matriarch to defend the
faithful from demons and monsters, and are called up as witchhunters when wayward mages dabble in forbidden arcana.
Their holy missions transcend sovereign borders, but the order
is headquartered in the Holy City of Lumen in Elyria.
Paladins are revered figures in the Faith of the Sacred Flame,
as the founder of the faith was herself a paladin. Though not
every warrior in the Silver Order is a paladin, each strives to emulate Saint Tarna’s valiant example. Though they usually operate as individual questing knights or in small warrior-companies,
occasionally they are deployed as a regiment. Members of the
Silver Order have been traditionally drawn from all peoples and
Knights of the Silver Order
all levels of society. Nobles and commoners are found within the
Order, and one’s station in life does not reflect one’s position in
the Order.
In their role as witch-hunters and mage-slayers, the Silver
Order was complicit in the persecution and oppression of arcane
spellcasters. To this day, the issue remains a deep stain on the
order’s honour, as many observed that the injustices and persecution visited upon spellcasters stand in stark contrast against
the tenets of the faith of the Sacred Flame, a faith that calls out
for justice for the oppressed. Nevertheless, staunch supporters
of the Silver Order argue that their deeds were indeed justified.
Decisive action is necessary to defend the innocent and the
faithful from wicked sorcerers who sought to dominate others
with magical might, or cut down foul warlocks who spread wickedness through demonology and necromancy. The chronicle
of the Silver Order records countless heroic missions that have
prevented a dire threat from growing into a far greater crisis.
The Silver Order answers to the Faith of the Sacred Flame,
not to the command of any sovereign nation. However, the
Order remains strongly connected to its roots, and most of its
members hail from Elyria. Ever since the realm of Elyria came
under the de facto rule of the religious ministry, the order has
become increasingly entangled in state affairs. Their knights
have been deployed on inquisitional crusades against heretics,
heathens, and other political enemies of the Sacred Flame. The
distinction between an “enemy of the Sacred Flame” and an
“enemy of Elyria” is not entirely clear anymore. As such, some
worry the Order’s presence in Drakkenheim is an invasive ploy
by Elyria to wrest control of Westemär, rather than a righteous
expedition to purify the city of eldritch contamination.</p>
<p>As befits their name, the knights are clad in silver plate with
gold filigree. They wear flowing tabards of white, prominently
decorated with symbols of the Sacred Flame, rather than any
individual heraldry. The Flamekeepers who accompany the
knights wear religious vestments of white and gold.</p>
