<h2>orgins of the meteor</h2>
<p>“Magic attracts more magic. Under extraordinarily rare circumstances,
magical energies crystallize into delerium. The stones slowly draw
more raw magic into the world from distant planes, possible realities,
and alternate dimensions. The rate is exponential. Considerably more
leakage occurs around vast quantities of delerium. These chaotic
energies are inherently destabilizing. Unfocused magic conjures up
paradoxical improbabilities at random, leaving behind lingering eldritch
contamination. Uncontained, these magical forces manifest as the Haze.
More delerium forms within, and so the process accelerates.”
– Archwizard Ryan Greymere</p>
<p>The meteor left behind vast deposits of delerium, enough to
manifest an erratic magical field called the Haze. New delerium
deposits gradually emerge within the Haze, which causes the
affected region to expand slowly over time. Left unchecked, the
Haze can overtake an entire world within a few centuries, leaving
behind a chaotic landscape of churning madness and wild magic.
The infected world cataclysmically shatters when more destructive magic inevitably erupts, sending a hail of delerium-filled comets throughout the cosmos. After hurtling through the Astral Void
for eons, some collide with new worlds where the process begins
again. Countless worlds have met this fate, the rest are wholly
ignorant of the doom that might one day descend upon them.
If nothing is done to stop the spread, the Haze will fully
engulf Westemär in roughly one hundred and fifty years. Once
this happens, little hope for reversal remains, and the dread
mists will envelop the world two centuries thereafter. Civilization
and society collapse into a monster-filled wasteland that
catastrophically ruptures about one thousand years later.
None know the complete truth about the Haze at the outset
of the campaign, and little knowledge is revealed via divination
magic save mad whispers. Throughout the adventure, player
characters may find clues about delerium from which they
may develop their own theories and speculations regarding the
origins of the meteor. They can learn much by exploring deep
into the ruins, especially locations such as the Inscrutable Tower,
the crater, and Castle Drakken. Faction leaders and malfeasant
wizards might also offer their research and insights to help
players along the way</p>
<h2>A long Lost heir</h2>
<p>None have yet discovered that King Ulrich von Kessel IV and
Queen-Consort Lenore von Kessel were both transformed into
monsters. Ulrich is now part of the hideous Amalgamation in
Castle Drakken, and Lenore has become a mad creature hiding
in Queen’s Park. Their children haven’t been seen in fifteen
years. It’s up to you to decide whether or not they survived, and
where they might be found.
Chapter 2: Running the Campaign 11
12 Dungeons OF Drakkenheim
Beyond the immediate offspring of Ulrich IV, however, many
relatives and cadet branches exist. As such, the House von
Kessel family tree has been left intentionally vague so you and
your players may freely insert your own player and non-player
characters as potential heirs. They need not be one of Ulrich’s
known children, but instead illegitimate offspring, a grandchild,
niece, nephew, or other family relative. The most dramatically
compelling possibilities include:
h One or more player characters (known or unbeknownst to them)
h A close relative of a player character (offspring, half-sibling,
cousin, or niece/nephew)
h The Queen of Thieves or a faction lieutenant (see the NPCs
entries for specific ideas)
Furthermore, there is no need for there to be a single surviving
heir, or even any at all. Anyone can say they have royal blood.
It’s another matter to prove it, and gain the support to actually
take the crown. Finally, it’s possible another noble household
could gain sufficient political clout and military power to turn a
tenuous claim into a credible one, and simply supplant House
von Kessel entirely.</p>
<h3>complications</h3>
<p>At the outset of the campaign there is no heir apparent to the
throne, nor have any credible claimants to the throne stepped
forward. There are many reasons why a potential claimant to
the throne hasn’t emerged yet. Decades of affairs, disaster, and
war have ravaged the public records, and conclusively determining heredity via magical means requires the blood or remains of
Ulrich IV. While an heir could possess a locket, signet ring, or
some other document, this must be substantiated with something from the ruins to prove their identity and ancestry. Consider introducing one of the following additional complications:
h Kept as a long-forgotten prisoner in an iron helmet in the
Queen of Thieves’ dungeon.
h Grew up adopted; no idea about their true parentage.
h Working as a humble stablehand living in Emberwood Village.
h Secretly hidden and protected by a distant noble house.
h Petrified into a statue in Castle Drakken.
h Accidentally banished to another plane.
h Succumbed to contamination; transformed into a monster.
h Secretly an arcane spellcaster; disinherited under the Edicts of
Lumen. (See Appendix E)
h Target of an assassination attempt by faction agents; have
been hiding since.
h Born from an affair; their birth was kept secret to conceal
a scandal.</p>
<h1>The seals of Drakkenheim</h1>
<p>These six wondrous items were entrusted to the royal council of
Westemär. Each identifies the bearers as important administrative and political figureheads. In addition to their potent magical
powers (described in Appendix D), the seals have an important purpose in a special coronation ritual that attunes a new
monarch to the Crown of Westemär itself (described in chapter
9). As such, many factions seek these seals, which are thought
lost in the ruins. A few are already in the hands of several faction
agents however! Here’s where you can find them though:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Chancellor’s Crest. Balrin Barthes failed to escape
Drakkenheim, and was transformed into a monster. This
mutated wretch still wears the Chancellor’s Crest, and serves the
horrific Duchess deep in its lair below the cistern.</li>
    <li>Inscrutable Staff. Adriana Modiera, the Archmage of
Drakkenheim, died within the Inscrutable Tower. This mighty
magical staff remains there today. Traditionally, the Amethyst
Academy has the right to determine who holds this staff.</li>
    <li>Lord Commander’s Badge. Elias Drexel survived the fall
of Drakkenheim and spent years fighting in the Civil War before
taking charge of the Hooded Lanterns. He still holds his original
badge of office. </li>
    <li>Phylactery of Saint Vitruvio. High Flamekeeper Gregora
led the faithful in the Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio. Her true
fate is unknown, but now a monstrous garmyr priest carries the
phylactery in the cathedral. It is traditionally entrusted to the
highest ranking cleric of the Sacred Flame in Drakkenheim, as
this item is also one of the Relics of Saint Vitruvio.</li>
    <li>Spymaster’s Signet. Spymaster Magdalena Vasari was a
half-elf assassin. A loyal operative through-and-through, Vasari
took advantage of her assumed death to secretly seek any
surviving heirs of the royal family during the Civil War. She
may have succeeded had she not been killed and her signet ring
stolen by the Queen of Thieves several years ago.</li>
    <li>Steward’s Seal. Johann Eisner, the royal steward, became
trapped in Castle Drakken after failing to rescue Ulrich IV.
However, he entrusted his young daughter with hiding his seal
as a precaution for this exact predicament. While her fate is now
unknown, the seal is now amongst the treasures of the Crimson
Countess in the Cosmological Clocktower.</li>
