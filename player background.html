<h1>Dungeons of Drakkenheim charecter back grounds</h1>
<p>to be used if you do not want to use the ones in the PHB</p>
<h1>Continental Nobility</h1>
<p>Requirements: Any class except sorcerer, warlock, or wizard</p>
<p>You are the scion of a noble household. Whether you hail from
Caspia, Elyria, or Westemär, the fall of Drakkenheim has either
adversely impacted your family’s fortunes, or created a tantalizing
opportunity to increase your political power and influence.</p>
<p>Skill Proficiencies: Two of the following: Persuasion,
Athletics, History, or Intimidation</p>
<p>Languages: Two of your choice</p>
<p>Equipment: A signet ring or brooch bearing your family crest,
a cape in the colours of your house, a set of fine clothes, and a
pouch containing 25 gp.</p>
<p>Feature: Noble Confidence</p>
<p>During a short rest you can give an inspiring pep talk to a
number of allies equal to your proficiency bonus. Once in the
next 8 hours, each of those allies can roll 1d4 and add it to the
result of a single attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.</p>
<p>Defining Event (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I was well celebrated in my city as a slayer of a great troll.</li>
<li>2 I witnessed the death of my family during the civil war. They were
targets for their ties to the von Kessel name.</li>
<li>3 I led my knights to victory in defending our castle during a raid in
the war.</li>
<li>4 I lost a lot of good soldiers in an earlier expedition into
Drakkenheim. We never made it past the gate.</li>
<li>5 My house was an enemy of the von Kessel family and had many
battles with them.</li>
<li>6 I broke ties with my family when they folded to the Silver Order.</li>
<li>7 I am related, not to a king or queen, but to a noble figure who
sat in the small council and made important decisions for their
represented house.</li>
<li>8 My family lost everything in the destruction of Drakkenheim. We
are noble only in name, no longer in standing.</li>
<p>Personality Trait (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I consider myself a renowned monster slayer, and like to remind
everyone of the many accomplishments I hold to my name.</li>
<li>2 I keep family traditions close. Honour and family are amongst
the most important things in the world, and I cherish them.</li>
<li>3 I miss the comforts of my home. This city is dirty and smells terrible.</li>
<li>4 I believe in the good in people, and I hope to find a peaceful
resolution to our problems. A diplomatic approach is something
Westemär greatly needs.</li>
<li>5 As a noble, I have a responsibility to protect those who cannot
protect themselves.</li>
<li>6 It is highly important that I look my best and maintain my regal
demeanor in all situations. My reputation must go untarnished.</li>
<li>7 I may be of noble birth, but have lived life on the road for some
time. I am more than willing to share what I have with others, as
I am no better or worse than anyone else.</li>
<li>8 There is no challenge I can’t face. I heard about the horrors and
monsters of this world, and I am what they fear the most.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Respect. I am a respected member of my family, and I expect
what remains of Drakkenheim’s nobility and royal line to
acknowledge my standing. (Lawful)</li>
<li>2 Responsibility. It is my responsibility as a representative of my
noble line to remain cordial, and diplomatic in dealings with the
various high ranking members of Drakkenheim’s society. (Good)</li>
<li>3 Privacy. I do not wish for my nobility to come up. It may be best
if the people of Drakkenheim do not know who I am. At least for
now. (Any)</li>
<li>4 Duty. It is my duty to aid the people of Drakkenheim. As a noble I
was connected to this city, and it is what is expected of me. (Good)</li>
<li>5 Glory. I must claim my victories and prove myself in battle. (Any)</li>
<li>6 Family. Blood is thicker than water and I will fight to defend my
family’s honour. (Good)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bond (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I must prove myself as a great warrior for my house and my people.</li>
<li>2 My family was once bound to the royal family of Westemär, I
must ensure we remain bound to whoever takes the throne.</li>
<li>3 My family’s fortune was lost. Drakkenheim may be our last
chance to get it back.</li>
<li>4 My family was betrayed by one of the royal houses, and I plan to
make sure any that remain of that name are brought to justice
and my family takes its place where it belongs.</li>
<li>5 I am destined to rule, as my ancestors before me have.</li>
<li>6 I have been sent unwillingly on a diplomatic mission to Drakkenheim. I am to gain political standing in these crumbling ruins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaw (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I boast about my own triumphs, and belittle the
accomplishments of others.</li>
<li>2 Bound by honor, I can never back down from a challenge, nor can
I let those who undervalue my name go unchallenged.</li>
<li>3 I do not like getting my hands dirty. Other people must do the
heavy lifting, not me.</li>
<li>4 I like to flaunt my wealth, and I spare no expense.</li>
<li>5 I’m never wrong. Even if I was, I would never admit it.</li>
<li>6 I was forced to lead, but I am very far out of my depth and
desperately hoping people do not catch on that I don’t know
what I am doing here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variant: Last of the Line
In the years following the destruction of Drakkenheim, calamity
and misfortune wracked your house leaving you the sole
surviving heir. Penniless and without land, you have come to
Drakkenheim to rebuild your family’s legacy.</p>
<h1>Mageborn</h1>
<p>Requirement: You must be a bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard</p>
<p>You manifested arcane magical abilities at a young age, and were
taken into the guardianship of the Amethyst Academy. You
learned to harness your magic at a secluded magical school. After
you came of age and completed your apprenticeship, you became
free to pursue your own interests, but you must respect the laws
and customs that govern all those with spellcasting powers. Under
the Edicts of Lumen, mages are disinherited of any noble titles,
and cannot own land.</p>
<p>Skill Proficiencies: Two of the following: Arcana, Deception,
Investigation, Perception</p>
<p>Languages: Draconic or Elven</p>
<p>Equipment: A gnarled wand made of wood, a duster jacket,
a satchel for material components and potions, an amulet or
other trinket of importance to you</p>
<p>Tool Proficiencies: Either calligraphers’ supplies or alchemists’ supplies</p>
<p>Feature: Bookworm</p>
<p>Once per day after you finish a long rest, you can spend one
hour to create a spell scroll. You need only paper and ink to
do so, and the level of the spell you can create equals one half
your proficiency bonus (rounded down) or lower. The scroll you
create must be a spell you know or have prepared.</p>
<p>Mageborn Quirk (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 My eyes are two different colours.</li>
<li>2 Whenever I cast a spell, my voice echoes and an unknown wind
seems to blow around me.</li>
<li>3 My eyes glow with octarine light when I am casting spells.</li>
<li>4 I hear voices and sounds when close to magical entities, as if the
magic itself speaks to me.</li>
<li>5 I have full conversations with myself out loud that occasionally
can get heated.</li>
<li>6 Magic floods my mind and makes it difficult to sleep without
constant nightmares and visions.</li>
<li>7 I speak to beings from other planes of existence who manifest as
simple creatures before me.</li>
<li>8 I have a birthmark in a unique shape that appears every day for 2
and a half hours, then vanishes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality Trait (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I idolize one of the archmages of the Academy and hope to prove
myself to them in time.</li>
<li>2 Nothing will get between me and my goals. When people say
something I care about is impossible, I prove them wrong.</li>
<li>3 I am confident in my powers, and do not fear the horrors of
Drakkenheim, for I can bend reality.</li>
<li>4 I am constantly reading books. The more knowledge I can obtain,
the more I can outwit friends and foes alike.</li>
<li>5 I am a mage for hire and am not afraid to use my magic to get my
hands dirty. A lot of people will pay top coin for a skillset like mine.</li>
<li>6 I am a sucker for a good mystery and pride myself in my ability to
solve them.</li>
<li>7 Everyone is always so serious - we all die in the end, might as well
enjoy the ride.</li>
<li>8 I always push myself to be the best at whatever it is I set out to do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Respect. My powers are a blessing and a curse, and I work
diligently to show people not to fear magic. (Good)</li>
<li>2 Knowledge. I left the Academy on good terms to work at one of
the many historical institutes of the world, hoping that my love
for books and history would be of use. (Any)</li>
<li>3 Love. I left the Academy due to love, and I plan to keep my
promise to that love. (Good)</li>
<li>4 Forgiveness. I must undo the mistakes of my past by proving
myself to those I care about most. (Good)</li>
<li>5 Power. Delerium is power, and I must learn all I can about its
origins and properties if I am to harness that power. (Chaotic)</li>
<li>6 Independence. I stand alone from the Academy for a reason. I do
not wish to be on their bad side, but I do not wish to be on their
good side either. (Neutral)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bond (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 It is my duty to protect the Amethyst Academy.</li>
<li>2 My life’s work in the study of delerium caused my expulsion. I
must continue that research to prove its value.</li>
<li>3 The mysteries of my past and my power are tied to the meteor. I
need answers.</li>
<li>4 My terrible mistake was covered up by my mentor in the
Academy. I owe them my life.</li>
<li>5 My nightmares have guided me to Drakkenheim. I must
investigate these visions.</li>
<li>6 I come from a long line of wizards, my exit from the Academy was
highly upsetting to them and I need to earn my way back into
their favour, even if it means risking my life in Drakkenheim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaw (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I walk straight into danger. What’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li>2 I believe my plan is always far superior to everyone else’s.</li>
<li>3 I am distracted by possibilities of gaining knowledge or power,
regardless of the cost or danger.</li>
<li>4 I overcomplicate most situations with small details and over
analyzing simple things.</li>
<li>5 I get angry quickly, and cause more harm than good with my
magic when I get mad.</li>
<li>6 I can’t get enough delerium. I want the power for myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variant Mageborn: Malfeasant Mage
You were expelled from the Amethyst Academy for some
trespass, real or imagined, or perhaps you were never taken in
by them and learned magic on your own. Common folk are
often mistrustful of spellcasters who do not wear the Amethyst
Academy colours, so you may need to hide your identity and
abilities, especially from the Amethyst Academy and the
Knights of the Silver Order.</p>
<p>Devoted Missionary</P>
<p>You are a follower of one of the many religions of the world.
Through either divine calling, visions, or prophecies, or because
your church sent you as an envoy and representative, or maybe
because you are seeking divine answers, you have made the
journey to Drakkenheim. What sacred purpose lies in the ruins
that you are quested with uncovering?</p>
<p>Skill Proficiencies: Two of the following: History, Religion,
Arcana, Nature</p>
<p>Equipment: A set of pale robes, a small chip of delerium
encased in glass, a walking stick, an amulet with a symbol of
your chosen god, a small book of religious text</p>
<p>Languages: Any two of your choice</p>
<p>Feature: Guided by Faith</p>
<p>A number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, you
may ask the Game Master to reveal the DC of any ability check
you make before rolling the dice. You may then decide whether
or not you wish to attempt the roll.</p>
<p>Missionary Life (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I was on a quest of self-enlightenment.</li>
<li>2 I ritualistically surround myself with lit candles and ancient texts
when I rest.</li>
<li>3 I had taken a vow of silence until the time that my voice was
needed to fulfil my destiny.</li>
<li>4 I was the caretaker of ancient relics of our faith and am quested
with finding others.</li>
<li>5 I am but a pilgrim hoping to find divine light in dark places in
the world.</li>
<li>6 I was guided to my faith by angels who rescued me from my dark past.</li>
<li>7 I broke my vows to my faith and was exiled. I seek redemption.</li>
<li>8 I must prove myself worthy to my faith and its purpose, no matter
the amount of blood spilled or lives lost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality Trait (1d8)</P>
<ul>
<li>1 I empathize with those who do not follow the path of light.
Creatures of all types can be brought back to the path of
righteousness and are often suffering and in great pain.</li>
<li>2 I believe in the words of my religion and quote its texts and
scriptures as often as I can.</li>
<li>3 I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or
condemn) the worship of other gods.</li>
<li>4 I have spent my life in a temple or church. Rough living wears on
me quickly.</li>
<li>5 I believe very strongly that everything will turn out okay, and
nothing can shake my positive attitude.</li>
<li>6 My faith kept me distant from others. I have very little
experience with the world outside the church/temple/shrine.</li>
<li>7 I have extremely strict etiquette and manners for interactions and
tasks, and I refuse to stray from them.</li>
<li>8 I am working on my thesis of religious ongoings in the world
and excitedly discuss the nuances of these ideas with anyone
and everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Logic. Emotions must not cloud our judgement on what is right
or true. (Lawful)</li>
<li>2 Self. My religious journey is that of discovering myself. If I can
obtain that, there is nothing left to know. (Any)</li>
<li>3 Charity. I will always help those in need, no matter the cost.
(Good)</li>
<li>4 Faith. The path laid out before me is determined by the divine
entity I worship. I will follow its signs and patterns to fulfil my
purpose. (Lawful)</li>
<li>5 Power. The gods have granted me divine powers and I must use
them to make those who do not worship as strongly as I see the
divine light and understand that I am the one true speaker of my
faith. (Chaotic)</li>
<li>6 Peace. I do not like to be part of conflicts, rather a neutral voice
of reason to all sides. (Neutral)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bond (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Nothing is more important than my church and what it represents.</li>
<li>2 I joined my religion to hide from a past I would rather forget.</li>
<li>3 The path to enlightenment is unending. I must stay the course.</li>
<li>4 I will die if it means doing right by my religious beliefs.</li>
<li>5 Everything I do is for the good of the common people.</li>
<li>6 I seek to preserve the ancient texts and artefact of my religion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaw (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I judge others harshly and believe my path to be the one true path.</li>
<li>2 I believe in the words of my religion so strongly that I follow them
without question.</li>
<li>3 The goal I have set for myself is my destiny, and I can not act
against it or abandon it for any reason.</li>
<li>4 My religion was meant to keep the dark thoughts at bay, but I
find myself losing that battle and a blood thirst grows within me.</li>
<li>5 This is my first taste of life outside my religion, and I enjoy its
pleasures a little too much.</li>
<li>6 The gods and my faith have determined that I am always correct
as I speak on their behalf. There is no question in my mind
that I speak the ultimate truths and any who do not agree are
misguided fools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Variant Devoted Missionary: Stargazer
You witnessed the meteor 15 years ago. Whether you believe
it to be destiny, a magical or divine calling, or just curiosity of
the secrets that need to be unearthed, you are drawn to the
crater. You believe that the crater holds some answers to the
questions you seek, and that somewhere in Drakkenheim
lies a truth beyond your comprehension. Your pilgrimage to
Drakkenheim may have taken you weeks, months or even
years but you had to come - something called you here and
you must discover its origin.</p>
<p>Survivor</p>
<p>Not everyone left Drakkenheim after the meteor. Some stayed
behind, searching the ruins for things they lost: friends and family,
or just seeking out treasure and artefacts. You know what places
in the city are the most dangerous, what paths are the best to
take, and often have an idea of the fastest ways to travel. Despite
the Haze, and dangers, you’ve managed to survive, but carry the
weight of Drakkenheim’s madness with you.</p>
<p>Skill Proficiency: Two of the following: Perception, Survival,
Stealth, Athletics.</p>
<p>Equipment: Cook’s utensils, climber’s kit, a shovel, a pair of
thick gloves, a cloak with a hood.</p>
<p>Tool Proficiencies: Cook’s utensils, one other set of artisan’s tools</p>
<p>Feature: Makeshift Meals</p>
<p>You know how to purify food and rations found in the ruins.
When you take a short rest, you prepare a meal for a number
of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus. Creatures who
consume the food regain hit points equal to your level. Once
they do, they can’t regain hit points from another one of your
meals until they finish a long rest.</p>
<p>Marks of Survival (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Being alone for so long means I am very used to conversing with
myself out loud.</li>
<li>2 I eat things that others find disgusting. I have learned to love the
delicacies of scavenged food in the ruins.</li>
<li>3 I have many scars across my body from barely scraping by.</li>
<li>4 I am missing a finger on one hand due to a horrible encounter I
had in the ruins.</li>
<li>5 I keep a locket of someone I lost in the ruins. I stare at it every
night before I fall asleep to remember what I am looking for.</li>
<li>6 I keep souvenirs of the monsters I have bested in these ruins, to
remind myself how strong I truly am.</li>
<li>7 I can sleep just about anywhere, nothing really phases me
anymore.</li>
<li>8 I often recite the names of people I used to know and lost so I
can hold on to their memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality Trait (1d8)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I always have an exit strategy in mind if things go poorly.</li>
<li>2 You can’t survive in this grim city without a good sense of humor,
but I have a taste for gallows humor.</li>
<li>3 I try to work in the thin grey area between the squabbling
factions, squeezing under their radar when possible. The less I am
seen, the better.</li>
<li>4 If you spot danger, it is best to avoid it, that’s how you survive.</li>
<li>5 Drakkenheim is a dangerous place. But I can navigate it with my
eyes closed. No one else I’ve ever met is as good as I am.</li>
<li>6 In order to survive the monsters of Drakkenheim, one must be a
monster of Drakkenheim.</li>
<li>7 Take everything you can from the dead, take it from the living if you
can. If you are to survive, you must take any opportunity to scavenge.</li>
<li>8 I will never give up until I reclaim what I lost in these ruins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideal (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Self-Reliance. I won’t risk my life for others. Everyone must fend
for themselves -- better you than me. (Evil)</li>
<li>2 Bravery. I find the thrill of surviving the monsters and magics of
Drakkenheim exhilarating and thrive on the chaos. (Chaotic)</li>
<li>3 Safety. Whatever I can do to keep myself fed and keep a safe
place to rest is good in my books. (Any)</li>
<li>4 Helpful. People need all the help they can get in the city, and I
know I can provide it. (Good)</li>
<li>5 Hope. I believe there is something worth saving here, we must
hold on to the idea of a better future. (Good)</li>
<li>6 Responsibility. I lived here before the meteor, I’ll live here long
after. I must protect my home and do what I can to make it
livable again. (Lawful)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bond (1d6)</p>
<ul>
<li>1 I had family in these ruins. I know not what became of them, but
I must find out.</li>
<li>2 This city is my home, and I will fight for what’s left of it until the
very end.</li>
<li>3 I’ll do any dirty work in the city if it means a hot meal, a warm
bed, or some good company.</li>
<li>4 I’ve spent so long in these ruins, its the outside world that
terrifies me now.</li>
<li>5 Why haven’t I left Drakkenheim? Have you seen how much gold
there is to be made here?</li>
<li>6 I am bound to the throne of Drakkenheim, and fight to see it one
day reclaimed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaw (1d6)<p>
<ul>
<li>1 Any meal could be my last. I’ll eat just about anything. I do what
I must to survive.</li>
<li>2 I don’t like being outside the Haze of the city for too long, I’ve
gotten used to it.</li>
<li>3 I am convinced my family is alive in the city somewhere. I hear
their voices call to me at night.</li>
<li>4 I don’t trust anyone easily. I’ll sleep with one eye open even around
my companions, for Drakkenheim makes monsters of us all.</li>
<li>5 The years spent here have turned me to a vice, I very much rely on
that vice to get me through my days.</li>
</li>6 I hear voices constantly. Sometimes I get distracted with
conversations with people who are not there.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Variant Survivor:</h1>
<p>Veteran of the Civil War
You survived the civil war that ravaged Westemär, either as a
soldier or fleeing refugee. The war took something from you
and changed you. It may be that you had to do things that went
against your morals, or perhaps you lost friends and family in
the bloodshed. Regardless, you walked away with scars that will
not easily heal.</p>
<p>Treasure Seeker</p>
<p>Lost treasure and valuable relics brought you to Drakkenheim.
Perhaps the prospect of earning more gold than you can spend
in your lifetime is too tantalizing to pass up, or alternatively you
may seek items for their historical or religious significance.

parted ways years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personality Trait (1d8)</p>
<li>1 I believe that I am destined for greatness, and nothing can
convince me otherwise.</li>
<li>2 I always have a plan or plot to outwit my foes. It may not always
be good, but it’s almost always overly complex.</li>
<li>3 I love to flaunt my wealth and showcase the things I have bought
with it.</li>
<li.4 I pay no mind to the risks of a situation. I always bet on myself and
my abilities and it’s gotten me this far. Never tell me the odds.</li>
<li>5 I have a quip, allegory, or joke for almost any situation.</li>
<li>6 I lie about anything and everything. I lie for almost no reason at
all, sometimes just to see if I can fool the people around me.</li>
<li>7 I use flattery and honeyed words to get what I want.</li>
<li>8 I can’t help it if valuable objects lying around end up in my
pockets. It’s for safe keeping.</li>
<p>Ideal (1d6)</p>
<ul> 
<li>1 Independent. No one tells me what to do. I make my own rules,
and my own luck. (Chaotic)</li>
<li>2 Fair. I do not take anything from anyone who couldn’t afford to
lose it. I am a treasure hunter, not a thief. (Lawful)</li>
<li>3 Family. I care about material possessions and wealth, but not as
much as I care about my friends and family. (Good)</li>
<li>4 Aspiration. Wealth is power. Wealth means you will be
remembered. In this world making a name for yourself is as
simple as acquiring enough gold to buy your way to victory.
I intend to be remembered. (Any)</li>
<li>5 Danger. Every great discovery requires risk. The greater the risk, the
greater the reward. It’s the thrill of the hunt that I live for. (Any)</li>
<li>6 Dignity. The dead and their prized belongings deserve more
than to waste away in the ruins. They deserve to be found,
remembered, and taken care of. (Lawful)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bond (1d6)</p> 
<ul>
<li>1 My desire for wealth is out of a need to protect my family.</li> 
<li>2 Something important to me was stolen. I’ve longed to get it back
ever since.</li>
<li>3 I’m wanted for my many crimes and hope that where I am going,
the law will not follow.<li>
<li>4 I made mistakes in my past that cost me the life of someone
I loved. I will not let that happen again.</li>
<li>5 I plan to be the greatest thief or most cunning explorer of all time. 6 This is my last job, the big one. After this I hope to settle down
with my wealth, maybe start a family.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flaw (1d6)</p>
<ul> 
<li>1 My entire identity is layers of falsities presented to hide my true
self, for I am not a good person. I’ve never told the truth for as
long as I can remember and it’s too late now to stop.</li>
<li>2 Every situation, every person, is only as valuable to me as what I
can gain from them. I’m not afraid to pull strings to bend luck in
my favour.</li>
<li>3 I jump to defensive measures as soon as someone catches me in a
lie, or tries to call me out for anything.</li>
<li>4 I take what I want, and I want it all.</li> <li>

<p>Variant Treasure Seeker:
Soldier of Fortune
Rather than seeking your fortune from finding treasure, you seek
yours by hunting down the brigands, outlaws, and monsters that
now hide in Drakkenheim. You often take up dangerous bounties
and follow wanted posters as long as the price is right. Danger
is second nature to you and the horrors of the city are nothing
compared to the thrill of the hunt, and the coin it can gain you.</p>
