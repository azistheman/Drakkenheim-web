		<h2>The Original campaign</h2>
		<p>The adventure in this book is based on the Dungeons of
		   Drakkenheim live stream campaign broadcast by the Dungeon
           Dudes which ran from October 2018 to December 2019. It
           featured Kelly McLaughlin as Sebastian Crowe, Jill Danaitis as
           Veo Sjena, Joe O’Gorman as Pluto Jackson, and Monty Martin
           as Game Master.
		   You can watch it on the Dungeon Dudes YouTube Channel
		   (www.youtube.com/dungeondudes) and find it on most major
		   podcast platforms. Check it out if you’re looking for inspiration for
           how we ran the adventures in this book, but be warned: spoilers
		   abound! We’ve also created a wealth of instruction videos for
           players and Game Masters covering everything about tabletop
		   roleplaying games, from character building to designing campaigns.
		   Every major event, location, and non-player character is
		   detailed in this book, and we’ve included many more completely
		   new ones for you to explore in your own game. In many ways, the
		   original campaign was a playtest for this book, and we’ve refined
		   and updated several sections since. If you’ve watched the original
		   series and notice an inconsistency between this book and the
		   show (there are many), the version in this book takes precedence.
		   On the flipside, you should feel empowered to alter, change, and
		   expand the material here, especially if doing so builds stronger
		   connections or better stories for you and your players.
		   The events of our original campaign are non-canonical with
		   regards to this book, so several elements of Drakkenheim strongly
		   connected to the original characters have been altered or removed.
		   If you wish, the original “Drakkenforce” characters may appear
		   in your campaign as rival adventurers, but their stories have been
		   set aside herein so your players may take centre stage.</p>
