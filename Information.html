<h1>World Information!</h1>
<p>DRAKKENHEIM IS NO MORE. An eldritch storm
of falling stars devastated the city on that woeful eve,
leaving behind a meteorite that would have lasting
effects. Fifteen years later, Drakkenheim is a dismal
urban wasteland contaminated by otherworldly magic and
haunted by hideous monsters. Fantastic wealth, lost knowledge,
and powerful artifacts lie ready for the taking by adventurers
brave or foolish enough to venture into the ruins. However, even
those who survive the dangers of Drakkenheim may not return
unmarked by its terrors! </p>
<h1>Delerium</h1>
<p>Iridescent crystals of vast magical potential are found throughout Drakkenheim. Known as delerium, these lambent stones
emanate unnatural energies that induce madness and monstrous
transformations. Despite these dangers, delerium is ideally suited
to crafting magic items and fuelling mighty new spells. Sorcerers,
warlocks, wizards, and all manner of occult magicians crave its
supernatural power, thus delerium commands a high price within
arcane circles and underground markets alike. Many prospectors
risk everything to collect a few fragments, but the true origins of
the strange mineral remain unknown. The rival factions stand
divided over whether the crystals should be destroyed, harnessed,
or worshipped, and their simmering disagreements threaten
outright war</p>
<h1>Broken Realm</h1>
<p>Drakkenheim was the cosmopolitan capital of Westemär, ruled
by the imperious House von Kessel. A decade of bloody civil
war erupted after the city’s destruction. The realm was left
shattered and the royal line broken. Now, the political order of
the wider world lies in shambles, torn apart by religious schism
and military conflict, and only a faint hope remains that the city
can be rebuilt and the nation restored. </p>
<h1>The Haze</h1>
<p>There are more hazards in Drakkenheim than monsters and rival
factions. A billowing mist filled with glinting multi-coloured motes
has settled over the entire city, which adventurers call the Haze.
It’s like the dust never really settled after the meteor fell.
Characters gain no benefit from taking a long rest
within the Haze. Adventurers should be well-rested before they
head into the ruins, as they’ll need to escape the city to regain
their hit points and spell slots. This effect cannot be circumvented
by any mundane equipment, nor bypassed with spells such as
rope trick, tiny hut, or similar character abilities.</p>
<h1>Contamination</h1>
<p>Characters will also encounter deadly eldritch contamination
caused by creatures, delerium, and other magical phenomena
in Drakkenheim. Abilities, equipment, and spells that protect
against diseases, magic, or poisons do not work against contamination. It cannot be healed naturally, nor readily removed with
low-level spells. Player characters will need to work with the
factions and find creative solutions to manage these problems
during their adventures.</p>
<h1>Fall of House von Kessel</h1>
<p>House von Kessel ruled Westemär from the capital of Drakkenheim for one hundred fifty years. The last monarch, Ulrich IV,
inherited a period of relative political stability, and so pursued
interests in architecture, education, and carnal affairs instead
of politics and warfare. He married a Caspian princess, Lenore,
and they had three children: Leonard, Katarina, and Eliza.
Ulrich IV was ten years into his reign when the meteor struck
Drakkenheim. The King, his wife, and their children were never
seen again after that day, but their true fate remains a mystery.
However, many members of the royal household were not
in Drakkenheim when the meteor struck, including the King’s
younger siblings, Mannfred and Cecilia von Kessel. The two
spent vast sums commissioning the clergy of the Sacred Flame
and the mages of the Amethyst Academy to use divination
magic to discern what happened, but to no avail. They nearly bankrupted themselves by launching multiple large-scale
military expeditions attempting to reclaim Drakkenheim, all of
which failed. Eventually, Mannfred became convinced further
efforts were futile, and proposed he would take up the crown
and relocate the capital. However, Cecilia contested the claim,
arguing there was no conclusive evidence that confirmed their
brother and his children were dead. The nobility was divided
over the issue, and a civil war ensued that raged for nearly a
decade. As Westemär itself descended into political and financial
ruin, Mannfred von Kessel and his children were assassinated in
a dramatic betrayal. Cecilia von Kessel herself died unexpectedly only a few days later, leaving behind no heirs of her own.
Lacking a clear successor, the Civil War ended with a whimper.</p>
<h1>The Royal Family</h1>
<p>Since the royal household were recognizable public figures in
their lifetimes, any character proficient in History instantly
recognizes them in artwork or portraits.
h King Ulrich von Kessel IV was a portly man of average
height with a wiry beard and rather unremarkable features,
artwork often exaggerates his appearance with a heroic barrel
chest, a lush curly beard, and a regal countenance. Stately
artwork shows him clad in a royal mantle wearing the Crown
of Westemär. Those who knew the King in life remember him
as a capable if overindulgent ruler who left most matters of
state to his administrators.
h Queen Lenore von Kessel was a woman in her late thirties; six feet tall with graceful limbs, hair dyed bright orange,
and bleached white skin. Her face had chiseled and angular
features, and with every gesture she struck a pose. She wore
outrageously ornamented gowns and jewelry, including a
famous golden necklace set with eleven emeralds.
h Leonard von Kessel was eighteen years old when the
meteor struck, but would be thirty three years old now.
Leonard took to military interests at a young age. Artwork
often depicts him as an aristocratic young soldier with sandy
brown hair wearing a dragon-decorated breastplate and
wielding a longsword.
h Katarina von Kessel was an inquisitive and acrobatic
eleven-year-old with wide eyes and auburn hair. She typically
wore a frilled shirt, fitted trousers, and cape instead of dresses,
and had a penchant for stealing hats. She would now be
twenty six years old.
h Eliza von Kessel was only six years old at the time of the
disaster. The button-nosed child was usually dressed in a
bonnet and patterned dress. Assuming she survived, she
would be twenty one years old today. </p>
