<h1>Knights of the Silver Order</h1>
<p>The Knights of the Silver Order are an organization of oathbound paladins and devout warriors sworn to combat supernatural evil, dark magic, and otherworldly incursions. The
questing knights normally travel the realms in small bands and
companies, and adhere to the Faith of the Sacred Flame, the
dominant religion across the continent</p>
<h1>Followers of the Falling Fire</h1>
<p>not much common knolage is currently known</p>
<h1>Hooden Lanterns</h1>
<p>Formally known as the 4th Provisional Expeditionary Force
to Reclaim the Capital, the Hooded Lanterns are an irregular
military drawn up from veterans of the Civil War and remnants
of the old Drakkenheim City Watch. Led by the dour Lord
Commander Elias Drexel, they wage a guerrilla war against
the monsters, bandits, and scavengers who have taken root in
their nation’s capital. Each has pledged their swords and lives to
rebuild Drakkenheim and restore the Realm of Westemär. Several noble houses have set aside their feuds to support the Hooded
Lanterns’ efforts.
<h1>Queens Men (the bad peaple)</h1>
<p>not much is know about the Queens men other then there a band of theives that have taken over the ruins</p>
<h1>Amethyst Academy</h1>
<p>The Amethyst Academy is a magical school for sorcerers and
wizards, where students learn magic in remote castles and
secluded universities. Directed by a shadowy cabal of powerful
archmages, the Academy also operates an enterprising mage
guild that controls the manufacture of magical wares, and
orchestrates an influential arcane syndicate that provides
occult counsel to the nobility of the continent. However, the
Academy was dealt a terrible blow following Drakkenheim’s
destruction, as the city was home to their greatest stronghold:
the Inscrutable Tower.</p>
<h1>Personal Quests</h1>
<p>A character’s core motivation for adventuring in Drakkenheim is
represented by their personal quest. This is a specific individual
objective for player characters to achieve during the campaign,
but players need not reveal their personal quest to each other.
When a character completes their personal quest, they choose
one of the following rewards:
Ability Score Improvement. One ability score of your
choice increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.
New Feat. You gain a bonus feat of your choice, subject to
the GM’s approval.
Player characters may select from the quests below, or work
with the Game Master to design one</p>
<un>
<li>Apocalyptic Vision. I have been haunted by visions of the
meteor for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing
down upon me. My personal quest is to see for myself what lies
at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there
in order to stop these nightmares.</li>
<li>Arcane Secrets. Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim.
Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible
and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands
unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My
personal quest is to learn these spells.</li>
<li>Blighted Landscape. A blight on the natural order envelops
Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the
city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena
found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen’s Park
Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater’s Edge.
Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.</li>
<li>Claim the Throne. Though my family has fallen on hard
times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel.
I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal
quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for
sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I
will take the crown for myself.</li>
<li>Faction Aspirant. I believe strongly in the ideals and goals
of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the
Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knightsof the Silver Order, or the Queen’s Men. My personal quest is to
join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a
high leadership position within their organization.</li>
<li> gh leadership position within their organization.
Family Matter. One of my family members or close friends
has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they
have foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively,
they’ve been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass
or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring
them back home.</li>
<li>Find a Cure. I have a friend, family member, or loved one
who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster.
They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim.
My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to
reverse their horrific transformation.</li>
<li>Lost Heirloom. I used to live in Drakkenheim. My
personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home,
which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the
item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family.
Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use
these powers to aid my own ambitions.</li>
<li>Monster Slayer. I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy
by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three
of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim,
and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable
creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when
I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the
decisive blow myself!</li>
<li>Overwhelming Debt. I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000
gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by
making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder,
and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from
bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.</li>
<li>Personal Pilgrimage. As an acolyte of the faith, my personal
quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred
ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the
Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina’s Monastery, and the
Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will
understand my place in the divine order.</li>
<li>Score to Settle. I have come to Drakkenheim to kill one
of the faction leaders: either Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver,
Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, Lord Commander Elias
Drexel, Lucretia Mathias, or the Queen of Thieves. Perhaps I
seek revenge for a past wrong. Alternatively, I may covet their
position and wish to replace them. Either way, my personal
quest is to slay them.</li>

<h1>Four Quick Facts about
the World of Drakkenheim</h1>
<ol>
<li>The gods are silent and distant. They don’t manifest
physically nor speak with worshippers, and do not interfere
in earthly matters. Planar cosmology is mysterious and
unknowable, but sages have still developed many conflicting
(and wildly incorrect) theories.</li>
<li>Divine spellcasting powers aren’t granted by gods.
Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins tap into sacred energies
through devotion, meditation, and resolve. Violating one’s
religious tenets won’t result in a loss of this ability, but a crisis
of faith might.</li>
<li>Individuals can’t become wizards through study alone.
The arcane magic of both sorcerers and wizards alike is borne in
the blood, which may be harnessed via practice and study. The
laws of the land bar arcane spellcasters from holding noble titles.</li>
<li>High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally
rare in the wider world. Despite their few numbers, such
people still have a profound impact on society. However,
Drakkenheim has attracted an uncommonly high concentration of such individuals.</li>
