		<h1>Personal Quests</h1>
		<p><strong>Please do these. they are really fun and give rewards</strong><p>
		<p>A character’s core motivation for adventuring in Drakkenheim is
			represented by their personal quest. This is a specific individual
			objective for player characters to achieve during the campaign,
			but players need not reveal their personal quest to each other.
			When a character completes their personal quest, they choose
			one of the following <strong>rewards</strong>:
			Ability Score Improvement. One ability score of your
			choice increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score.
			New Feat. You gain a bonus feat of your choice, subject to
			the GM’s approval.
			Player characters may select from the quests below, or work
			with the Game Master to design one</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Apocalyptic Vision. I have been haunted by visions of the
				meteor for fifteen years. Every time I sleep, I see it crashing
				down upon me. My personal quest is to see for myself what lies
				at the heart of the crater. I must overcome whatever I find there
				in order to stop these nightmares.</li>
			<li>Arcane Secrets. Forbidden lore lies in Drakkenheim.
				Several dark wizards living in the ruins have mastered terrible
				and powerful new magic. The Inscrutable Tower library stands
				unguarded, filled with spellbooks containing secret arcana. My
				personal quest is to learn these spells.</li>
			<li>Blighted Landscape. A blight on the natural order envelops
				Drakkenheim, but the contamination could spread beyond the
				city. My personal quest is to study the unnatural phenomena
				found within the most corrupt places in the city: Queen’s Park
				Garden, the underground waterways, and the Crater’s Edge.
				Perhaps then I can develop a way to reverse the contamination.</li>
			<li>Claim the Throne. Though my family has fallen on hard
				times, we were distantly related to the royal House von Kessel.
				I may have a claim to the throne of Drakkenheim. My personal
				quest is to search the cathedral, noble estates, and the castle for
				sufficient evidence to conclusively prove my inheritance. Then I
				will take the crown for myself.</li>
			<li>Faction Aspirant. I believe strongly in the ideals and goals
				of one of the five factions: either the Amethyst Academy, the
				Followers of the Falling Fire, the Hooded Lanterns, the Knightsof the Silver Order, or the Queen’s Men. My personal quest is to
				join the faction, aid their mission, climb the ranks, and rise to a
				high leadership position within their organization.</li>
			<li>the leadership position within their organization.
				Family Matter. One of my family members or close friends
				has become mixed up with one of the factions. Perhaps they
				have foolishly decided to join the organization. Alternatively,
				they’ve been taken prisoner by the faction due to some trespass
				or misunderstanding. Either way, my personal quest is to bring
				them back home.</li>
			<li>Find a Cure. I have a friend, family member, or loved one
				who was contaminated by delerium and turned into a monster.
				They have gone mad, and are lost somewhere in Drakkenheim.
				My personal quest is to locate them, then discover a way to
				reverse their horrific transformation.</li>
			<li>Lost Heirloom. I used to live in Drakkenheim. My
				personal quest is to recover a lost heirloom from my old home,
				which was located somewhere in the Inner City. Perhaps the
				item is sentimental, valuable only to members of my family.
				Alternatively it may have magical properties, and I wish to use
				these powers to aid my own ambitions.</li>
			<li>Monster Slayer. I wish to leave behind a heroic legacy
				by defeating dread beasts. My personal quest is to slay three
				of the greatest monsters rumoured to dwell in Drakkenheim,
				and bring back their heads as trophies. Each must be a notable
				creature with a challenge rating greater than my own level when
				I defeat them. My allies can assist me, but I must strike the
				decisive blow myself!</li>
			<li>Overwhelming Debt. I owe a tremendous debt of 10,000
				gold pieces, maybe more. My personal quest is to pay it back by
				making a fortune in Drakkenheim collecting delerium, plunder,
				and completing work-for-hire. Meanwhile, I must hide from
				bounty hunters my creditor send to kill me.</li>
			<li>Personal Pilgrimage. As an acolyte of the faith, my personal
				quest is to visit several holy places in the city and perform a sacred
				ritual before the remains of the martyrs interred within each: the
				Cathedral of Saint Vitruvio, Saint Selina’s Monastery, and the
				Chapel in Castle Drakken. Through these devoted acts I will
				understand my place in the divine order.</li>
			<li>Score to Settle. I have come to Drakkenheim to kill one
				of the faction leaders: either Archwizard Eldrick Runeweaver,
				Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal, Lord Commander Elias
				Drexel, Lucretia Mathias, or the Queen of Thieves. Perhaps I
				seek revenge for a past wrong. Alternatively, I may covet their
				position and wish to replace them. Either way, my personal
				quest is to slay them.</li>

		<h1>Four Quick Facts about the World of Drakkenheim</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>The gods are silent and distant. They don’t manifest
				physically nor speak with worshippers, and do not interfere
				in earthly matters. Planar cosmology is mysterious and
				unknowable, but sages have still developed many conflicting
				(and wildly incorrect) theories.</li>
			<li>Divine spellcasting powers aren’t granted by gods.
				Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins tap into sacred energies
				through devotion, meditation, and resolve. Violating one’s
				religious tenets won’t result in a loss of this ability, but a crisis
				of faith might.</li>
			<li>Individuals can’t become wizards through study alone.
				The arcane magic of both sorcerers and wizards alike is borne in
				the blood, which may be harnessed via practice and study. The
				laws of the land bar arcane spellcasters from holding noble titles.</li>
			<li>High-level NPCs and spellcasters are exceptionally
				rare in the wider world. Despite their few numbers, such
				people still have a profound impact on society. However,
				Drakkenheim has attracted an uncommonly high concentration of such individuals.</li>
