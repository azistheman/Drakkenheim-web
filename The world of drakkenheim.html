<h1>The World of Drakkenheim</h1>
<p>this section describes the overarching world</p>
<h1>Realms of the Continent</h1>
<p>The people who inhabit the world of Drakkenheim simply call
it “the earth” or “the world”. They live on “the continent”
that is divided into several nations which people refer to as
“the realms”. The largest and most politically influential of
these sovereign states are Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär.
Neighbouring each are several petty kingdoms and dozens of
city states.</p>
<h2>Westemär</h2>
<p>The Realm of Westemär stretches north from the Drakeclaw and
Glimmer Mountains, along the Crystal Coast to northern tundras.
The heartland is made up of deep dark forests surrounding wide
flowing rivers, interspersed with areas of fertile marshland. The
land is prosperous and rich in natural resources: iron, salt, and
coal mines, fine timber, and excellent quarries. These industries
supported the realm’s once-great military strength and built
the impressive architecture of its cities. As such, the nobility are
distinguished, but materialistic and prideful, in contrast to the
hard-working and pragmatic common folk.</p>
<h3>A Broken Realm</h3>
<p>Drakkenheim was the capital of Westemär and home to the
ruling family, House von Kessel. After the meteor fell, the two
surviving scions of House von Kessel clashed over succession in a
brutal civil war that tore the nation apart. After many assassinations, accidents, and disastrous battles, the civil war ended with
no clear victor. Most believe House von Kessel is now extinct, and
the throne remains abandoned and empty in the ruins of Castle
Drakken. The lands surrounding Drakkenheim are now contaminated, and most villages nearby are deserted.
Lacking a sovereign ruler, the nobility manages their own
domains directly. They remain deeply divided based on which
branch of House von Kessel they supported during the civil war.
Many grievances remain, and occasional skirmishes occur between the squabbling barons, counts, and dukes. However, after
nearly a decade of fighting, their coffers are empty and their blood
is spent. Few possess the will or resources to continue these feuds
for the time being. Many noble families possess some relation to
the royal line, yet none have the political clout or military strength
to press a claim upon the throne and reunify the nation. </p>
<h2>Elyria</h2>
<p>The realm of Elyria lies on a large peninsula south of the Drakeclaw Mountains. The land comprises vast rolling prairies and
river basins broken up by rocky arid hills and a mountainous
coast. Nestled within are pockets of imposing pinewood forests,
and great deposits of precious minerals such as gold and silver.
Elyrians are known for being kind-hearted and outgoing folk
eager to share the bounty of their land. Most live a rural life in
small villages along the rivers and coasts. Indeed, the fertile river
valleys at the heart of Elyria were an early cradle of civilization,
and the countryside is dotted with the ruins of ancient cities.
The Holy City of Lumen is the capital of Elyria. The Faith of
the Sacred Flame was founded here, and the shining city is the
seat of power for the Divine Matriarch. The most fervent and
orthodox adherents to the faith are found amongst the Elyrian
people. Beyond Lumen, there are few large cities save several
bustling port towns that are hubs for international trade. The
Elyrian navy is amongst the finest in the continent.</p>
<h3>A Rising Theocracy</h3>
<p>Originally, Elyria was a monarchy, but today, the nation is effectively a theocracy ruled by the Divine Matriarch. As leader of the
Faith of the Sacred Flame, the Divine Matriarch has traditionally
been regarded as a pillar of wisdom, truth, and justice, so they
often mediate difficult political matters. When the Elyrian royal
line went extinct, a parliament drawn from the Elyrian nobility
determined that the Divine Matriarch would appoint a Lord Regent to lead them. Together, the noble parliament and the Lord
Regent would serve as a ruling body for the nation.
However, in recent decades, successive Divine Matriarchs have
used this power to select a line of caretaker regents who defer to
the Faith on virtually all matters of state. While members of
the clergy take vows of poverty that preclude them from holding
actual political station, the parliament is now mostly made up
of fundementalist nobles staunchly loyal to the religion, and the
Lord Regent is almost always a close relative of a prominent High
Flamekeeper or the Divine Matriarch. As a result, the Divine
Matriarch wields de facto political authority in Elyria</p>
<h2>Caspia</h2>
<p>The realm of Caspia stretches in an expanse between the
Glimmer Mountains and the Diamond Sea. It is a rugged and
mediterranean nation, home to a boisterous and affable people
led by a constantly squabbling nobility.</p>
<h3>The Kingsmoot</h3>
<p>Caspians elect their High King once each decade, from candidates put forth by the princes of their noble houses. The valorous deeds and reputation of the noble houses is a major factor
in determining the High King. Though Caspian politics are
always shifting, especially as the next Kingsmoot draws near, it
has stood as a remarkably stable nation. As such, Caspians love
to meddle in the politics of Elyria and Westemär. They often
intermarry with the nobles of different realms to gain greater
clout and influence for the next Kingsmoot.</p>
<h2>Wars and Conflicts</h2>
<p>The realms have been shaped by centuries of war, from Elyrian rebellions against ancient sorcerer-kings, to great battles
between rival Caspian princes, and most recently, the civil war
that ravaged Westemär.
By law and custom, none with arcane spellcasting powers may
hold a noble title within the realms. Instead, the noble houses
prize the martial arts. Many fighting traditions have developed:
armoured phalanxes, archery, fencing, berserking, and diverse
unarmed combat techniques. Duels and trial by combat are
a particularly favoured means to settle disputes amongst the
nobility with minimal bloodshed. The realms of Caspia, Elyria,
and Westemär have each developed their own distinctive styles
and practices for such contests.</p>
<h2>Travel and Trade</h2>
<p>Commerce, rather than conflict, defines everyday life for
common folk in the realms. Merchant caravels and ships
frequently carry cargo across the Diamond Sea from the
Caspian port of Jackson’s Keep or the independent city-state of
Liberio. Other vessels depart from the ports of Drannsmund in
Westemär and Angel’s Landing in Elyria, and sail the Middle
Ocean to the far west. Trade caravans from Geldstadt travel
across the Twin Vales to distant lands beyond the steppes.
Magical goods and services are bought and sold throughout
the continent, but only amongst the wealthy and powerful.
High-ranking nobles outfit their favoured knights with magical
arms and armour, and rich merchants buy spells and wondrous
items to safeguard their valuable mundane wares. The
manufacture and sale of arcane commodities is controlled by the
Mage Guild, a branch of the Amethyst Academy. Under strict
edicts recognized across the realms, any mage or trader dealing
in magic pays an annual fee to the Mage Guild, and must follow
the prices set by the guild.
A few are bold enough to skirt these requirements. As a result,
smugglers, hired muscle, and rogues can make their fortune in
the illicit trade of enchanted gear and forbidden magic items.
This underground black market has only expanded since
delerium has become such a valuable and sought-after export.</p>
<h2>free lands</h2>
<p>Though the realms boast mighty armies and legal customs, these
have little authority outside cities and settled farmlands. Not far
off the major trade roads and rivers, the wilderness remains a place
ruled by the laws of nature, not the laws of mortals. The dark forest
of Achtungwald, the wet bogs of the Elfmire, the massive mountains that separate the realms, the northern tundras, and the arid
hills of Elyria are dangerous lands, where dragons, trolls, giants, and
monsters keep their lairs.
However, these wild places are also home to many people
who do not reside under the control of the realms. Living in
small tribes, they keep their old ways and old faiths, led by
stout-hearted warriors and druids who embrace the fury of
the elements.</p>
<h2>the wider world</h2>
<p>The continent meets the vast Middle Ocean along its western
coast. Across this body of water is a distant continent. While
bold and well-travelled merchants often make the voyage, few
folk in the realms know anything of those antique lands.
East of Westemär are the Twin Vales, nestled between great
mountain ranges. Beyond these are expansive steppelands and
vast deserts that lead to parts unknown. Off the Crystal Coast, to
the north, is the island of Skye, further beyond is the North Pole.
South of Caspia is the Diamond Sea; across are realms that often
trade with Caspia and Elyria.</p>
<h1>Magic and Spells</h1>
<p>Magic suffuses the world of Drakkenheim, but mortal spellcasters
are rare. Only about one in every thousand people can cast spells,
and roughly two-thirds of these only ever master cantrips and
first-level spells in their entire lifetimes. The few who can work
greater magic often wield tremendous personal, social, and political power. Though rare, magic is common currency for nobility,
clergy, wealthy merchants, and adventurers.
Only a handful of living mortals can cast ninth-level spells.
Most are secretive recluses or legendary figures. Harnessing more
magical might than most mortals can even comprehend, they
often turn their attention away from earthly affairs to contemplate
the cosmic order, fighting unseen battles against supernatural foes
whose very nature threatens to tear the world asunder.
The common folk regard spellcasters with superstition and
awe. There was a time when arcane magic users faced extreme
persecution, and echoes of those prejudices remain. Few even
understand the difference between sorcerers, warlocks, and
wizards — they are collectively referred to as ‘mages’. However, commoners can recognize spellcasters who are clerics of the
Sacred Flame or mages of the Amethyst Academy by their symbols and attire. Spellcasters who are not (or do not claim to be)
members of these recognized organizations are often mistrusted
and feared by commoners. </p>
<h2>Arcane Magic</h2>
<p>The arcane magic of sorcerers and wizards draws upon otherworldly energies. The ability to tap into these forces is reliant on
a recessive genetic trait in mortals - such individuals are called
mageborn. Signs that a person is mageborn typically emerge in late
childhood or early puberty, usually as random displays of wild
magic. In some rare cases it does not develop until adulthood.
Mortals who lack the mageborn gene cannot become sorcerers or
wizards under any circumstances.
By law, the Amethyst Academy takes guardianship over any
child born in the realms who manifests magical ability, whether
they are a royal heir or commoner. A child who bristles against
Academy training — or who was not taken in by them — most
often becomes a sorcerer.
Bards and warlocks also work arcane magic, but do not
necessarily depend on mageborn lineage to do so. Instead,
warlocks gain arcane power through pacts with eldritch entities,
and bards find supernatural inspiration to harness the Words of
Creation. Regardless, many keep their powers secret. </p>
<h2>devine magic</h2>
<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, divine spellcasting powers are
not granted by gods. Instead, clerics, druids, and paladins learn
to cast spells by channeling the supernatural forces of light and
shadow that underscore the cosmos. In theory, such powers are
attainable by anyone, but in practice only exceptionally gifted
individuals master even the lowest-level divine spells. As such,
divine spellcasting is viewed as a disciplined and sacred technique
attainable only by those with sufficient will and devotion, and
only after years of meditation and training. Its practitioners are
not considered mageborn.
Violating one’s religious tenets will not cause a cleric, druid,
or paladin to lose their powers. However, a personal crisis
of faith brought on by some discordant change in behaviour
and morality could cause an individual to lose their divine
spellcasting powers. More often, a cleric, druid, or paladin
who commits some grave trespass risks retribution from other
members of their religion.</p>
<h2>other spellcasters</h2>
<p>There are many rudimentary techniques for casting a small
smattering of cantrips and lesser spells, represented by rangers
and subclasses or feats that grant minor spellcasting features.
Such characters are viewed as merely dabblers, not mageborn.</p>
<h1>Faith and Religions</h1>
<p>In the world of Drakkenheim, gods do not physically manifest
in the world, intervene in mortal affairs, or speak directly with
mortals. Myths and legends passed down from distant eons
tell such tales, but these events have not happened in recorded
history. Instead, the inspired words of prophets, oracles, and
heroes laid the foundations for the world’s many religions.
Powerful extraplanar entities such as archangels, demon lords,
and outsiders exist and interact with mortals. Many extensively meddle in earthly matters, making pacts and offering dark
counsel. Some even claim to be gods. When asked questions
regarding the true nature of the cosmos or divinity, however,
they speak in cryptic riddles.</p>
<h2>The Sacred Flame</h2>
<p>This is the dominant religion throughout the realms. Also
known as the Divine Light, its teachings and beliefs are tightly
woven into the social and political fabric of Caspia, Elyria,
Westemär, and their neighbouring domains.</p>
<h3>background</h3>
<p>Myths about the Sacred Flame have ancient roots, but the contemporary religion began a thousand years ago with the valiant
Saint Tarna. Although most of her life she was a ruthless warlord,
light flickered in her dark heart. Guided by angels, she learned
to channel the Sacred Flame and became the first paladin. She
took up the cause of righteousness and sacrificed herself to defeat
an evil sorcerer-king. After her martyrdom, her disciples spread
her teachings and established the Faith of the Sacred Flame.</p>
<h3>Beliefs and Tenets</h3>
<p>Faithful of the Sacred Flame do not worship a deity. Rather,
devotees pray for guidance from a transcendent divine force that
they believe is the source of all light and goodness. Symbolized
as the Sacred Flame, this brilliant beacon inspires mortals to act
with benevolence, honor, and righteousness. The religion brings
a message of dutiful hope: even the smallest flame may light the
way through the darkest night. The core tenets of the religion
are conceptualized as follows:
h The Hearth spreads compassion. One must nourish the
hungry; offer shelter to the cold; and give succour to those
who suffer. Spiritual warmth comes when the community is
gathered together before the Flame as neighbours.
h The Lantern illuminates the way of truth. The light reveals
what is hidden by darkness, and shows the way to understanding. One should not silence truth, nor speak falsehoods.
h The Torch displays the duty of all faithful to uphold the cause
of justice. One cannot abide when evil stirs; nor stand idle
when corruption spreads: callousness and indifference permit
selfishness, greed, and hate to multiply.
h The Candle symbolizes hope and redemption. Show those
who are in darkness the light. Offer mercy to the guilty; no
shadow is absolute so long as a flickering flame remains.
Followers of the Sacred Flame believe that when mortals die,
the divine light guides righteous spirits to the place where dawn
breaks over the Shadowlands. Their luminous souls shine eternally, driving back the endless darkness that threatens all life.</p>
<h3>Holy Sites and Symbols</h3>
<p>A goblet of fire or a lit candle represents the Sacred Flame in
holy symbols. Believers join hands in a circle around a roaring
fire and sing hymns during worship rites. The holy text of the
faith is called the Song of Fire. Saint Tarna is typically depicted
as a silver-haired warrior bearing a longsword. She is often
shown in battle against demons and witches, sometimes astride
her griffon, Aarak.
In Caspia, Elyria, and Westemär, most towns have at least
one chapel devoted to the Sacred Flame. Often at the heart of
their communities, these domed sanctuaries are built around a
hallowed brazier set alight with a golden continual flame. Major
cathedrals to the Sacred Flame are found in large cities, and many
are brilliant architectural wonders in their own right, decorated
with painted murals, stained-glass windows, and statues depicting
the saints and martyrs. The small shrines in most villages are
usually simply an awning built over a bonfire pit.</p>
<h3>Religious Hierarchy</h3>
<p>keepers. These clerics of the Sacred Flame are predominantly
women*; they wear flowing vestments of white, yellow, and
gold. Flamekeepers take vows of poverty, eschewing all personal
possessions and living on the commonwealth of the faith.
Chapels and cathedrals of the Sacred Flame are ministered by a
Flamekeeper, who is assisted by a few devoted acolytes. Smaller
villages rely on lay ministers to keep their shrines. The highest
authority amongst the priesthood of the Sacred Fire is the Divine
Matriarch, who tends the Cathedral of Saint Tarna in the holy
city of Lumen in the land of Elyria.
* Although this represents the formal religious hierarchy, people of
any gender identity may become clerics and paladins of the Sacred
Flame and rise to positions of honour and reverence.</p>
<h3>Clerics of the Sacred Flame </h3>
<p>Through deep spiritual discipline and steadfast devotion, some
faithful may become living vessels for the Sacred Flame. These
rare individuals hold the power to channel its light in the earthly
realm to work divine magic. As clerics of the Sacred Flame, they
become enlightened healers, custodians of truth and knowledge,
or fiery beacons of light. However, not every cleric of the
Sacred Flame becomes a Flamekeeper or participates in the
organization and politics of the religion.</p>
<h3>Paladins of the Sacred Flame</h3>
<p>Legend claims Saint Tarna was the first paladin. These warriors
hold deep reverence amongst the faithful, as only truly virtuous
souls can wield the Sacred Flame as she once did. Paladins of
the Sacred Flame swear sacred oaths of devotion, redemption,
and vigilance. Inspired by Saint Tarna’s example, many
join knightly orders ordained for righteous purposes. Such
companies of holy warriors and their martial retainers embark
on quests and crusades to destroy supernatural forces of evil and
root out creatures of otherworldly darkness. The most wellknown and decorated amongst these militant fellowships are the
Knights of the Silver Order. </p>
<h2>Other Religions</h2>
<p>Although many people keep the Flame, there are hundreds of
smaller religions with disparate beliefs, doctrines, and practices.
Here are some of the most notable.</p>
<h3>The Old Faith</h3>
<p>This disparate religion is dedicated to a pantheon of primal
deities who have whispered to mortals through nature for
untold generations, such as primal Nodens, vengeful Kromac,
honorable Nuada, and nurturing Danu, but there are countless
more. Their beliefs and practices vary widely based on the
tenets of the specific patron god, but their myths often surround
the elements, the seasons, the land, and ancestor worship.
Many such beliefs originated with the ancient orcish and
dwarven peoples of the continent. Others are closely connected
to mysterious entities who inhabit extraplanar worlds such as
Dreamland, the Elemental Chaos, or the Feywild, and are often
kept by the elves. Druids are particularly common adherents
and priests of the Old Faith, but clerics and paladins of the Old
Faith are not unknown.</p>
<h3>Shadow Cults</h3>
<p>Throughout the ages, various ‘shadow faiths’ and heretical sects
have emerged surrounding the Sacred Flame, some of which
embrace an opposing force called the Exalted Darkness. These
cults develop their own mysteries and esoteric practices, or
devote themselves to worshipping enigmatic god-like beings
such as Morrigan the Phantom Queen, the Night Serpent, the
Lord of the Undead, and powerful entities who inhabit the
Shadowlands or the Abyss.
Some of these chthonic entities seek to devour the light and
plunge the world into darkness unending. However, not all
of these faiths are evil, with practitioners who view shadow
and light as part of a necessary balance. Regardless, followers
of the Sacred Flame condemn these beliefs, banishing their
rites and practices. In the same manner that deep faith and
contemplation leads followers of the Sacred Flame to become
clerics and paladins, one may also channel the Shadow itself.
Clerics are heralds of twilight, trickery, magic, and death, and
paladins often invoke dark oaths to vengeful causes or ambitious
conquest. Followers of the Shadow Faith may even become
warlocks, embracing dark and fiendish patrons.</p>
<h1>The Edicts of Lumen</h1>
<p>During antiquity, mighty sorcerer-kings ruled a continentspanning empire using their immense arcane power. The
sorcerer-kings became tyrants who scarred the land with magical
wars and held those without arcane magical power in bondage.
The iron rule of the sorcerer-kings was ended by the clerics and
paladins of the Faith of the Sacred Flame a thousand years ago.
However, those born with arcane magical ability have faced
discrimination ever since, and at times, the religious ministry has
endorsed vicious persecution against mages. Even today, many
common folk consider a mageborn child a terrible curse.
Outright conflict ended with the Edicts of Lumen, a magical
treaty between the Amethyst Academy, the continental nobility,
and the Faith of the Sacred Flame. Signed three centuries ago,
this agreement separates the political and economic powers of
clergy, mages, and nobles.
The Edicts of Lumen comprise six main articles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Articles of Inheritance bar all mages from holding
noble titles or owning land.</li>
    <li>The Articles of Neutrality require the Amethyst Academy
remain neutral and impartial with regards to the social,
economic, and political affairs of the continent, but also grant
protection under the law to all mages.</li>
    <li>The Articles of Guardianship grant the Amethyst Academy
the authority to take any child born with magical capabilities
as wards to train in magic until they come of age, including
mageborn of noble houses and royalty</li>
    <li>The Articles of Enterprise permit the Amethyst Academy
to operate as a self-governing mage guild to control the sale
of magical goods and arcane magical services throughout
the continent, but they may not discriminate or charge their
clients differently. </li>
    <li>The Articles of Malediction disallow the Academy from
teaching magical practices such as summoning demons and
creating undead, and forbid mages from using magic to
directly influence or control members of the nobility or clergy</li>
    <li>The Articles of Umbrage detail a complex system for
resolving minor infractions in a peaceful manner, reparations
for damages for more serious violations, and the circumstances
when parties may use violent force to enforce compliance. </li>
</ul>
<h1>The Cosmos</h1>
<p>Sages of the Amethyst Academy have put forth differing
theories to explain the order of the cosmos throughout history.
These included bizarre concepts such as the “great wheel”,
the “world axis”, the “conjunction of the spheres”, “planetary
orbits”, and “general relativity”. There is no consensus; every
theorist is quick to point out the glaring flaws and logical
inconsistencies in competing hypotheses.
Most mortal knowledge of the planes comes from contact
with extraplanar creatures via summoning magic or divination
spells such as contact other plane. Deliberate planar travel by
mortals is the stuff of legends. The knowledge and material
components for the plane shift spell are jealously guarded
secrets. However, there are countless ley-lines and thin places
where the unwary might slip between worlds. Described below
are the most well-known, but countless others exist. </p>
<h2>mortal worlds</h2>
<p>The mortal world is a sphere of rock that orbits a fiery sun.
Several moons and planets join this cosmic dance, all suspended
in an endless astral void. Far away, the sparkling stars are other
suns. Who can say what distant worlds lie among them?</p>
<h2>Otherworlds</h2>
<p>These worlds are metaphysically close to the mortal world, such
that some creatures can pass through the Ethereal Plane into
the mortal world, and rarely vice-versa.
The Ethereal Plane. A truly liminal space, this plane is
the metaphysical border between the mortal world and the
other planes.
Dreamland. This strange realm is the mortal unconscious
made manifest. It is a world of thoughts, dreams, and
nightmares, inhabited by impossible creatures.
The Feywild. The realm of fey is sometimes called by
different names, such as Tír na nÓg, Wonderland, Avalon,
Elfhame, and the Elusive Realm. It is uncertain whether or
not these names refer to regions within the realm or are in fact
distinct worlds entirely.
The Elemental Chaos. A primordial place of raw energy and
unbridled potential, the individual planes of air, earth, fire, and
water are found within its churning storms and burning seas.</p>
<h2>afterworlds</h2>
<p>The afterworlds are places where mortal souls go when they
die. There has been no recorded instance of a living mortal
physically entering these planes and returning. However,
the creatures who inhabit these worlds can be contacted or
summoned using powerful spells.
The Shadowlands. A dark reflection of the mortal world held
in perpetual gloom. Most souls pass into the Shadowlands on
their way to the afterworlds, but some wander here forever. Why
certain souls remain in this place, and others pass on is the subject
of many religious myths. The energies from this place may be
invoked to create undead.
Eternity. The sacred celestial afterworld where angels dwell.
Little is known about this holy place, but many religions believe
it is a paradise for righteous souls.
The Abyss. Interchangeably referred to as Hell, sages
believe that mortal souls are transformed into demons or devils
in this fiendish afterworld. These evil beings plot mayhem
and conspiracy against mortals when they are not waging
endless war amongst themselves. Few mortals understand the
distinction between such fiendish creatures.</p>
<h1>Peaple of the continent</h1>
<p>Many different people lived in Drakkenheim. The neighbouring
countryside and the realms beyond are no less diverse, though humans make up the majority of the population in the current age. In
ancient days, the industrious dwarven folk built great underground
empires, the alien elves raised mystical towers, while the orcish people constructed monuments and menhirs to honor their old gods.
Today, their descendants and those of many other ancestries inhabit
the continent, though few would associate their varied biological
distinctions with any single nation, culture, or religion.</p>
<h2>Dwarves</h2>
<p>Many dwarves tell tales of ancient underground kingdoms
that hoarded vast mines of gold and gems and fought great
wars miles below the surface. The foundations upon which
Drakkenheim were built date back to these times, and traces of
dwarven architecture and engineering can still be found in the
fortifications, aqueducts, and deep vaults of the city. However,
the days of the dwarven realms have long passed, and the
dwarven people have no great holds of their own any more. Still,
many dwarves dwell in the mountains and keep the traditions of
their ancestors: mining, smithing, and engineering. Many more
are much less tied to these traditions now, so it is not unusual to
see a small number of dwarves in just about any community. </p>
<h2>elves</h2>
<p>No one knows when elves came to these lands, or exactly how
they got here. Even the most ancient among them tell little
more than vague myths about their origins. These stories claim
that millennia ago, the elves came into this world through fairy
realms and shadow gates from a distant and long-lost land.
Why the elves left, none can say. Today, the elves live in diaspora. Only a handful of elven families dwell in even the most
populous regions. Although rare, they are no longer regarded
as strangers to these lands. In fact, half-elves are now much
more common than those of pure elven descent. Though elves
remember little of their history, they still possess great knowledge of magic. The few elven ruins found across the continent
contain mysterious portals and arcane lore. The reason they
were abandoned remains unknown.</p>
<h2>halflings</h2>
<p>These smallfolk often form their own communities within
settled lands, just as often as they live alongside the other people
of the continent. Many live a rural life, tending farms, orchards,
and fishing villages. Dozens of halfling villages surrounded
Drakkenheim, the bounty of their fields feeding the city.
Though these communities were not outright destroyed when
the meteor struck, they have not escaped its devastation. The
eldritch contamination spreading from the ruins and the threat
of monstrous raiders have forced many smallfolk to abandon
their homes. Their once-quaint underhill abodes and welcoming
hamlets are now eerie ghost-towns.</p>
<h2>Humans</h2>
<p>Most of the population of the continent are humans, who range
in all shapes, sizes, colours, skills, and beliefs. Humans tell
countless tales of their origins, and tend to regard wherever they
were born as home. They formed many of the great noble and
royal houses of the continent, and the endless conflicts between
these families have defined the political landscape of the realms.
One such family, House von Kessel, ruled Drakkenheim until
the meteor and years of civil war ended their regal line.
Humans have long mingled with other peoples, resulting in
half-elves, half-orcs, and half-dragons. Though such people
often bear distinct physical traits, such individuals are recognized for their shared human origin. Indeed, humanity has often
intentionally sought to enhance their lineages. During antiquity,
many powerful sorcerous dynasties infused their bloodlines with
the essence of infernal and celestial entities, bequeathing their
progeny with an enduring magical legacy. Though these old empires have long since fallen, their descendants have since spread
throughout the world.</p>
<h2>uncommon orgins</h2>
<p>Though their populations are sparse, many other peoples
inhabit the world of Drakkenheim, including catfolk, dragonborn, gnomes, goblins, orcs, and tieflings. No matter their
origin, there is no reason any type of character would be out of
place arriving in Drakkenheim. Players should work with the
Game Master to invent how their ancestry choice could have a
place in Drakkenheim.</p>
<h1>timeline</h1>
<p>Year -12. A golden comet leads Tarna to the archangels Gabrielle
and Michael, and she becomes the First Paladin. 

Year 1 The Martyrdom of Saint Tarna, who saved the world
from the madness of sorcerer-king Xandor XIII. After
her martyrdom, her followers share how to channel
the Sacred Flame and war against the sorcerer-kings.

Circa 300 Rule of the sorcerer-kings finally crumbles. More
learn to wield the Light of the Sacred Flame. These
faithful clerics organize the early religion.

Year 381 Vowing tyrannical mage-lords will never rule again, the
newly-established Divine Matriarch of the Sacred Flame
endorses persecution against arcane spellcasters.

Circa 500 Following a century of persecution, a group of
surviving mages form the Amethyst Academy as a
secret society to protect themselves.

Circa 600 House von Drakken establishes a petty kingdom
along the Drann River, where they lay the foundations
of Castle Drakken.
Year 678 The Knights of the Silver Order are ordained to hunt
down the Amethyst Academy.

Circa 700 Bloody wars break out between noble houses
supported by the Amethyst Academy and houses
supported by the Faith of the Sacred Flame.

Year 743 The Edicts of Lumen bring an end to the wars by
establishing a clear separation between mages,
clergy, and nobles.

Circa 800 House von Drakken goes extinct, setting off 150 years
of succession crises.

Year 965 House Von Kessel claims the throne of Drakkenheim
and establishes the Kingdom of Westemär.

Circa 1000 The monarchy of Elyria crumbles; the Divine
Matriarch appoints a Lord Regent.

Year 1,015 The Clocktower of Drakkenheim mysteriously stops.

Year 1,093 Lucretia Mathias pens an essay predicting the early
return of Tarna’s Comet, and that its earthly arrival
heralds the dawn of a new age for the faithful of
the Divine Light. Her apocalyptic predictions are
extremely unpopular within the mainstream clergy
and her writings are suppressed.

Year 1,111 The meteor strikes Drakkenheim on September 16th
at 8:13 PM.

Year 1,112 A failed attempt to reclaim Drakkenheim results in
thousands of soldiers dying in the Haze. The few who
return are stricken with madness.

Year 1,113 Lucretia Mathias greatly expands her original
work and publishes the Testament of the Falling Fire.
The accuracy of her early prediction garners her
a significant following, and she plans a personal
pilgrimage to Drakkenheim.

Year 1,114 After two more military expeditions to reclaim
Drakkenheim fail disastrously, the succession crisis
between the surviving members of House von Kessel
boils over, setting off the Westemär civil war.

Year 1,115 As the civil war rages, several groups of adventurers
investigate the ruins of Drakkenheim for plunder.
